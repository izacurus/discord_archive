a mind that's tracked 
a twice removed rhymetic stack define my heady crack
my deed's option's black 
with will on tap 
grilled charged to zap a pill end or I leverage tracks 
gravity like the large attract 
actually I guess I asked for that gratitute to my master rat
disaster blind after fat line flat line craft a cracked fine 
just trying to write arrived but this world has no right behind 
find a blacklist so I crime devise rate drieved but I drive it high
so I 
meet my finders kind
I don't listen to chemical frights or die my eyes are medical fright signs a head of your type
wrist lifted to grind I'm a hellenic dread height
a deviled keg whites yolk is heavy metal is lead pipes levi metal is head fried wires meddaled by a needle at 10 2 5
riddled dread but I'm dead why I just kid with my wit write tip dip let a bitch fly
swat with the flip wry from your hands but the grip's tight
imagine hearing this in the dead night over beat a tressprime 
I don't dress for the next sign but my words impress like a red sky 
scraper cracked elevator just a guess that I'll test later
let me out aligator step on out I'm up lever taper plumbing taper seal it heaven's draper 
deal with it devil maker a deal my mind in a pod but alotted racer circles turn tight and burn up eraser
levels burn with no chaser federal worth like the earth's creator 
disappearing haters rip my tears they fade ya best you afix my fearless favour a tip: traitors
slowly watched my fam get flipped, ripped and cripped but the system's switched to a saviour
still the anger savour not a bitch tripped into the trap a hitch glitched out and taze ya
I want out of this shit hole before my mind get braver and cave-a snitches brain to the pavement 
or delay it to a state assination buy my statements fuck it you couldn't even catch my weight up
walk in like cash so pay up walk is talk so later
